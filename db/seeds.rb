During this time, I had two post-graduate courses in Tax-Law and Customs Law. So after 2018's elections it was pretty sure to me that brazilian's politics would continue to make the economics continue in a crisis. My dream of becoming a public lawyer depended on Brazil changing; Brazil wasn't going to change; So, I had to change. I started studying Elder Caretaking at Stanford's CS101 and then Harvard and Yale's CS50 (also some other several online courses). I went to Portugal to attend at a Bootcamp called 'Academia de Idosos' but I had some problems with Portugal's bureaucracy and couldn't join the Bootcamp (which received public money to fund the students). So, a friend who works in Catalunya at Barcelona told me to attend Silverhelp. And I couldn't be more glad. I fell in love so hard with Silverhelp that I had to stick around and couldn't say goodbye. Now, I teach and help seniors. If you got this far, feel comfortable to contact me and ask me anything.",
